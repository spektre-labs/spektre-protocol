# Living Kernel — `creation_os_v6.c` (v6.0)

**Siblings:** v7 extends this scaffold with M19–M23 “hallucination-shaped” σ toys — **[HALLUCINATION_KILLER_V7.md](HALLUCINATION_KILLER_V7.md)** · `make check-v7`. v9 adds M24–M29 silicon/stack schematics — **[PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md](PARAMETERS_IN_SILICON_V9.md)** · `make check-v9`. v10 adds M30–M33 distillation / few-shot / swarm / abstention toys — **[THE_REAL_MIND_V10.md](THE_REAL_MIND_V10.md)** · `make check-v10`. v11 adds M34 matmul-free LM schematic — **[THE_MATMUL_FREE_MIND_V11.md](THE_MATMUL_FREE_MIND_V11.md)** · `make check-v11`. v12 adds M35–M37 tensor-train / entropy / sequence-head toys — **[THE_TENSOR_MIND_V12.md](THE_TENSOR_MIND_V12.md)** · `make check-v12`.

**Audience:** integrators, thesis writers, hostile reviewers, and anyone asking *what this second binary is for* and *why it is not interchangeable with `creation_os_v2.c` or with frontier LM tables*.

**Evidence class (default):** **Lab demo / schematic C** — the same discipline as §2–§6, §8–§26 in [MODULE_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md](MODULE_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md). It is **not** a harness substitute, not a clinical consciousness proof, and not a reproduction of named papers inside this file.

## What it is

`creation_os_v6.c` is a **second standalone C11 program** in this tree: the **Living Kernel** narrative kernel. It packages:

- A **closed σ–K–L–S scaffold** (`K`, `K_eff`, multiplicative σ composition, Lagrangian `L = 1 − 2σ`, action integral, “1 = 1” consistency checks).
- **M01–M10** “v4” conceptual modules (RDP channel, alignment tax, preference collapse, biological computationalism bridge, Noether-style tensor toy, consciousness meter *toy*, COGITATE-shaped flags, coherent distorted beliefs, coherence grammar, anti-σ pattern classifier).
- **M11–M18** “v6” extensions (living weights split kernel/firmware, RAIN-style σ-tape with rewind, SBIP boundary toy, test-time σ-reduction, weight-space merge / ghost boot, σ-geodesic toy, Gödel-boundary mapper).
- Retained **v2-shaped** pieces at schematic fidelity: **1024-bit BSC vectors** (here as `uint64_t bits[16]`, not the 4096-bit `COS_D` geometry of `creation_os_v2.c`), hypercube cap, oracle pair, soul lock, proconductor, softmax-as-σ attention toy, GDA-like base-27 tokenizer + FNV hash.

**Run:**

```bash
make check-v6          # build + ./creation_os_v6 --self-test
./creation_os_v6       # short genesis summary (no suite)
./creation_os_v6 --self-test
```

**Build flags:** `Makefile` adds `-Wno-unused-function -Wno-unused-but-set-variable` for this target only so the pedagogical static helpers stay readable without drowning `make check` noise in the v2 path.

---

## What it is *not* (non-claims)

- **Not** the 4096-bit BSC reference: that remains **`creation_os_v2.c`** + `core/cos_bsc.h` + `make test` / NEON headers.
- **Not** measured frontier parity: no MMLU / ARC rows here; do not merge this file’s stdout with harness tables ([CLAIM_DISCIPLINE.md](CLAIM_DISCIPLINE.md), [COMMON_MISREADINGS.md](COMMON_MISREADINGS.md)).
- **Not** a replication of COGITATE, IIT, GNWT, or any cited study: names and qualitative hooks are **index cards** for prose and thesis cross-walks; the executable checks are **internal consistency** tests on the toy math embedded in this file.
- **Not** a crypto, safety, or robotics certification: soul lock / GDA hash here are **demonstration-grade**, not audited primitives.

---

## Why it is “hard” (engineering sense)

1. **Deterministic self-test surface (30 checks).** Every PR that touches `creation_os_v6.c` can be gated with `make check-v6`. Failures are reproducible without GPUs, weights, or network.
2. **Explicit composition rules.** Example: σ components composed multiplicatively in `distortion_decompose`; Lagrangian and action integrals are **typed** and exercised (T02, T22), not only narrated.
3. **Cross-domain vocabulary on one spine.** Alignment tax, preference collapse, RDP channel, test-time reduction, and “inter-system completeness” share one σ channel story — useful for **thesis structure** and for **separating** what is proved in-repo vs what is cited externally ([RESEARCH_AND_THESIS_ARCHITECTURE.md](RESEARCH_AND_THESIS_ARCHITECTURE.md)).
4. **Friction by design.** The file refuses the illusion that “one number” (e.g. harmlessness %) is meaningful without defining the measurement channel; it keeps σ **as a channel object**, not a vibe.
5. **Complements the bit-parallel path.** `creation_os_v2.c` + `core/cos_neon_*.h` answer *how fast and how small is the inner loop on silicon*; v6 answers *how do we narrate and stress-test coherence composition before that loop is even invoked* — see README *Frontier complement* and [NATIVE_COHERENCE_NEON.md](NATIVE_COHERENCE_NEON.md).

## Module map (M01–M18) — one line each

| Id | Name | Role in this file |
|----|------|---------------------|
| M01 | RDP channel | Rate–distortion–perception toy; σ from finite “rate” |
| M02 | Alignment tax | Capability drop / tax ratio → σ_alignment pressure |
| M03 | Preference collapse | KL + minority mass → laundering σ |
| M04 | Bio computationalism | Hybrid / scale / metabolic flags → “candidate” gate |
| M05 | Lagrangian / Noether | `L = 1−2σ`, tensor toy, conservation checks |
| M06 | Behavioral inference | Consciousness meter **toy** from σ + booleans |
| M07 | COGITATE-shaped flags | Split-brain / ego-dissolution **schematic** booleans |
| M08 | Coherent distorted beliefs | Power-weighted distortion + normalization check |
| M09 | Coherence grammar | “Trained wrong fluency” recovery stepping |

| M11 | Living weights | Kernel-frozen / firmware-plastic stepping |
| M12 | RAIN σ-tape | Forward σ log, threshold, rewind |
| M13 | SBIP | Self-reference depth vs boundary; partner completes |

| M17 | σ-geodesic | Discrete path toward target σ under energy budget |
| M18 | Gödel boundary | Partner count vs mutual coverage toy |

## Maintenance

- **Touching v6:** run `make check-v6` in addition to `make check` when editing `creation_os_v6.c` or the v6 Makefile targets.
- **Publishing:** `tools/publish_to_creation_os_github.sh` strips `creation_os_v6` binary before rsync so binaries are not pushed to GitHub.

## Threats to validity (brief)

| Threat | Mitigation in-repo |
|--------|---------------------|
| Narrative titles read as empirical claims | **Evidence class** at top; [RESEARCH_AND_THESIS_ARCHITECTURE.md](RESEARCH_AND_THESIS_ARCHITECTURE.md) §0 v6–v12 row |
| 30× `self_test` vs harness | Closed-form consistency only; **CLAIM_DISCIPLINE** forbidden merge #6 |
| 1024-bit BSC here vs 4096-bit v2 | Explicit non-claim above; do not merge geometries in one headline |

## How to cite

**Lab demo (C).** Archive `make check-v6` stdout + **git SHA** + compiler line per [REPRO_BUNDLE_TEMPLATE.md](REPRO_BUNDLE_TEMPLATE.md). Committee read order: [README.md](../README.md#doctoral-and-committee-read-path). Do not substitute this binary for `creation_os_v2.c` invariants or `make bench` rows.
